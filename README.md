Title
Automating Member Registration in Culturetheque 

Description
When new members subscribe to Alliance Francaise de Dallas, or members renew their subscription, their information needs to be transfered from Arc En Ciel, our CRM software to Culturetheque, a library subscription that comes with the membership. Additionally, their emails need to be added to Constant Contact for email marketing. The Memberships.py script reads a csv from Arc En Ciel and uses post requests to create accounts in Culturetheque, or update the expiration date in Culturetheque for existing members. Additionally, it prints a list of emails to be pasted into Constant Contact.

Use
This script is intended to be used by Alliance Francaise divisions that may benefit from automating registration processes. Python needs to be installed.
